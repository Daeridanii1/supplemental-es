## Daeridanii's Contributor's Reference for the Successors

_Edited 2 March 2025_

#### What is this?
Something I experienced when I was a newer contributor to Endless Sky was a fear of "stepping on others' toes," as it were, when it came to making content for areas of the game where other contributors were the voices of authority. I wasn't sure what their plans, expectations, or "rules" were, and so I wasn't sure which of my ideas for content would conflict with these and which wouldn't.

I don't want others to be intimidated by the prospect of contributing content to the Successors, so this document is my attempt to eludicate some of the methods and patterns that I've used to define them so far, so that prospective contributors can feel like they have a more solid foundation to reference.

This is not to say that I won't like your PR if you don't adhere to every concept I am going to lay out or, conversely, that I'll instantly approve it if you fulfill every point. Nor is or should my approval be the be-all-end-all on what gets into the game. **This is a document for reference, not an absolute authority. It is meant to be helpful, not discouraging.** Happy reading!

#### What Am I Working On?
* My current main writing project for the Successors is the first chapter of their story, tentatively titled _Ghosts_. This will involve all of the High Houses in some capacity, will include making available the High Houses License, and will incorporate a mix of new and returning characters from the Successors canon.

#### Narrative Patterns
* The High Houses are scheming, manipulative, and treacherous. They are quick to give the impression of trust and slow to give to give _actual_ trust. None of them are likely to help the player unless they believe it is in their best interest. They are more than happy to lie to the player if doing so benefits them. Every one of them has secrets that they would kill to keep.
* The People's Houses are a melange of anti-authority figures trapped in a tea kettle. Some of them see themselves as genuine freedom fighters against an oppressive _status quo_; some of them are essentially pirate warlords; some of them are puppets of the High Houses propped up so the High Houses have a justification to maintain such large fleets. Like the player, the High Houses are happy to _use_ them when it suits their aims.
* Civilian Successors espouse a wide range of opinions on their political and social situations, and their feelings are probably messy and conflicted, because mess and conflict is what makes good story.
* The end of the Predecessors' empire is a continuing story element---the Successors idolize their ancestors and their achievements while largely shying away from confronting their culpability in this ancient disaster. One of my goals in writing the mainline Successor story is to force them to confront this more directly.
* The relationship between both modern and ancient Successors, and the Quarg and the Drak/Archons, varies from House to House and person to person---not as belligerent as in the Coalition nor as friendly as among the Hai or humanity. The Quarg and Drak/Archons helped the Predecessors evacuate, but also bear some responsibility for the loss of the more advanced Predecessor technology. Was this a good trade? Some Successors surely think so, and some probably don't.
* The Predecessor core systems---the eastern Tangled Shroud---form a scary and dangerous place, full of untold mystery. Additional systems may be revealed if one knows where to look; conditions in the systems may change after the appropriate story point, or systems may vanish entirely. Anything that's alive or active in there is to be feared.

#### Writing Details
* The Successors prefer cooler temperatures. Rooms that are comfortable for them are chilly for an moderately-dressed human from temperate climes.
* The Successors are amphibious in an extended sense of the term. Comfortable spaces generally have both dry and wet areas. Floors may be kept damp; pools or tanks may be kept as lounge areas, etc.
* The Successors stand much taller than humans (at least 3 meters on average), so spaces that are large enough for them will be especially large for humans, and spaces designed for humans will be very cramped to them.
* The Successors are a single-gender species, and I consistently use the singular they/them to refer to individuals.
    - I try to consistently use "themself" as the reflexive pronoun for individuals, mostly to disambiguate versus "themselves" as the plural reflexive pronoun.
    - I try to avoid giving any individuals particularly strongly sterotyped masculine or feminine characteristics, though there's definitely room for this, especially among individuals more closely engaged with human or other alien cultural records.
    - For the sake of avoiding uncomfortably thorny discussions surrounding reproduction, cloning, etc. I assume that two individuals are required for the production of offpsring.
* I try to avoid saying that the Successors "walk," given their squishy invertebrate nature---I tend to use words like "glide" or "slither" instead where description is needed.
* The Successors love their jewellery and accoutrements, especially the wealthy.
* I sometimes sprinkle some quotations taken from Shakespeare into the dialogue of Successor characters. This is fun! If you want an in-world explanation, consider that the translation device the player uses may be overly aggressive in translating phrases that are particularly close.
* The translation device that the player uses to communicate with the Successors is strange and uncomfortable, physically pushing around the air inside First Last's ears (via space magic) to form new sounds. It can be used to heighten tension or give a scene an unsettling mood.
* At least some of the High Houses [Sioeora] practice some form of mandatory service for their citizens.

#### Art
* Successor ships are sleek and armored. Some take inspiration from real-world aquatic life like dolphins and rays.

* Successor ships have reverse and turning thruster flares. Ship models have modeled physical thruster ports for these.
* Most civilian ships have ring-shaped elements (hyperdrive rings? perhaps) incorporated into their designs. For warships, these are generally not visible (perhaps they are internal, under layers of armor).
* Many Successor outfits are based off real-life technologies and (at least vaguely) resemble them. [e.g. pulsed inductive thrusters, coilguns]
* High Houses outfits often feature purely decorative ornamentation, but this should go over a functional-looking base. Ornaments are often organic-looking.
* Civilian Successor technology is mechanical and rugged, featuring fewer smooth lines than High Houses equipment. Sometimes, civilian equipment may take a design element from High Houses equipment and implement it more crudely. [e.g. "floral" patterns on the large betavoltaic cell versus the large fusion core]

#### Gameplay
* Early missions see the player running errands for the High Houses; the High Houses both want whatever it is they have the player doing for them AND want to gauge the player's capabilities.
* Content that is _intended to challenge the player_ is targeted to a (supposedly) late-game player who can engage with Tier 2+ warships. 
* The High Houses prefer to use kinetic weapons.
* Successor engines use shields as afterburner fuel; it makes sense that other parts of their technology might also use shields in unconventional ways.

#### Characteristics of the High Houses
* It can be effective narratively to divide the High Houses into "types," but one should always be careful not to do this so strictly that they become two-dimensional. 
	- Consider that these primary characteristics would probably be more displayed by higher-ranking members of the Houses---scions, etc. When I describe the "stereotypical" member of each House, keep the idea that these are stereotypes well in mind.
	- These stereotypes probably represent ideals in each House's unique culture---how might characters affected by these cultures be influenced by living up to these ideals, or failing to do so?
	- I'm including with each _a guiding question_, which I hope to work my way towards addressing for each in the first chapter of the Successors story. Some of these are more well-defined than others, but they might be helpful in understanding what sort of stories _I'm_ pursuing with each of them.
* **Aqrabe** is semi-monastic; no less wealthy or fond of wealth than the other Houses, but less prone to overt ostentation and more vociferous about moral virtue. _How do its perspectives on wealth and power differ from the other High Houses, and what does this mean for its role among them?_ It has a moderately sized population. 
	- A stereotypical Successor belonging to Aqrabe would be hard-working and capable, growing up in a small, efficiently-planned city, expressing a dry and atypical personality.
* **Chydiyi** is especially miltitaristic; it builds a lot of ships and manufactures a lot of equipment and so the Old Houses lean heavily on it to maintain their shared fleets. It is bound up by treaties regarding exports from its homeworld---_how does Chydiyi regard its being managed from elsewhere like this?_ It has a moderately sized population.
	- A stereotypical Successor belonging to Chydiyi would be disciplined and focused, growing up in a close-knit family who enjoy a modest personal estate close to a mine or factory.
* **Myurej** is especially populous and well-established, the House with the oldest territorial claims to what is now Successor space. More than any of the others, it enjoys and presents displays of opulence and grandeur. It is particularly xenophobic, combining saccharine pleasantry with acerbic distaste---it is the paragon of the Successors' aristocratic characterizations. _What vulnerabilities do its wealth and established nature conceal?_ It has the largest population of any House.
	- A stereotypical Successor belonging to Myurej would be fashionable, successful, and well-connected, growing up in a large city or busy section of Myurej's space station. Low-level individuals may be more open than higher-level ones.
* **Kaatrij** is especially secretive; its leadership is cagey and nebulous, and its internal structures are particularly opaque. Its nature as a composite of several otherwise-collapsed Houses makes it the House least biased against an unfamiliar alien (or unfamiliar person of any sort), but this relative equanimity does not entail trust. _Which group(s), if any, does Kaatrij trust?_ It has a small but diverse population.
	- A stereotypical Successor belonging to Kaatrij would be perceptive, careful, and just (by Successor standards), and perhaps a little unusual in their speech or naming. They might have grown up in an underwater enclave or moderately-sized community well-connected to other communities and the natural world around them.
* **Seineq** is the oldest extant House, trying to strike a balance between modernity and preserving tradition. It is the central member of the New Houses; neither of the others is as invested as it is. _What lengths might Seineq go to in order to ensure its alliance stays together?_ It has the largest population among the New Houses.
	- A stereotypical Successor belonging to Seineq would be forceful, active, and politically-savvy, located at the center of the New Houses' shared culture. They might have grown up near a spaceport, watching all manner of visitors pass by, and may have traveled between the worlds of the New Houses themself at an early age.
* **Sieoora** is particularly academic, well-respected for its technical skill, historical establishment, and prudent leadership. Like Myurej, their culture feels particularly stuffy and aristocratic, but may be mellowed by a greater awareness of other cultures and their own history. _In what ways is the historical knowledge that Sioeora prides itself on significant?_ It has a relatively small population.
	- A stereotypical Successor belonging to Sioeora would be intelligent, learned, and artistic, proudly touting their academic or cultural achievements. They might have grown up in a moderately-sized community, observing the goings-on at a nearby archaeological dig or university.
